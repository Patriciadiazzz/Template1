      <p>With the rise of Open AI, many notable and beginner writers have wondered what the future of book publishing will look like. Wondering where will AI draw the line between what is legal and copyright infringement.</p>

      <p>Recently, Mona Awad sued Open AI for copyright infringement due to her current book “Bunny” being used by Chatgpt to train its services to create summaries and book reviews. Without her knowledge, and breaking the copyright laws Chatgpt used her book “Bunny” to expand their language and capacity to connect with the server. </p>

      <p>Having Chatgpt incorporated into our day-to-day media, transforms the future of book publishing, with current Google searchers such as “Can I write a book with AI” and “What are AI writing Limitations”, writers find themselves wondering if Chatgpt will take over the writing industry, competing with them in an already narrow field. “I am worried that AI might be able to produce more and faster work than me”, said university student Shristi Saha.</p>

      <p>Writing, no matter in what genre has the ultimate goal of connecting people, and forming a community. The art of creating something human, to which other people can relate is what gives meaning to writing. Leaving many students such as Saha with mixed opinions against the server, “AI is not human, therefore it is unable to truly replicate human work”.

        <p> Lately, writing has lost its meaning, with the rise of Chatgpt it has become more about competition, who can produce the fastest and who can reach more people, succeding in separating humans from writing and creating a divide in the human and art. </p>

        <p>Mona Awad’s lawsuit awakes writers and the media to stand up against AI and the copyright Infrigments that they are often getting away with. “It is the main principle of AI stealing other artists’ work that bothers me” declared student Saha. It urges creatives to set a boundary between what we will allow AI to control and where will it not take over.

        <p>Awad just like every writer, fears for the future of book publishing. The stealing of human work devaluates the efforts of the writers and the amount of time it took them to produce their final draft.</p>
      
        <p>Just recently, more prominent American authors have spoken up about the copyright infringements that Open AI has committed against their work taking in it to court, hoping to represent <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/05/microsoft-openai-sued-over-copyright-infringement-by-authors.html#:~:text=In%20September%2C%20a%20group%20of,writers%20in%20Manhattan%20federal%20court." target="_blank">Fiction writers in Manhattan. </a> Creatives are starting to speak up against the stealing of their works all across the nation, creating a trend that will not stop until new laws have been set against Open AI and the liberty it has against copyright infringement. </p>
     
    
        <p>However, AI is not all negative, some students use it as a tool for planning or making study guides, ““As a student, I often use AI to help me plan for essays however, I still fear the overall control that it has over us” student Saha represents many university students when it comes to their use of AI. Nevertheless, one could argue that we are not using AI the way it should be managed, “I believe that we should use AI to help us work faster, so we can spend more time with family and friends, not make it so it takes away our jobs and we are all unemployed” declared university student Saha. It is about speaking up against the current violations of Open AI and defending authors and their work. </p>

        <p></p>

        <p>For Book readers, this means supporting and not consuming any server that supports the stealing of other people’s work. In order to see a change, readers have to use their voices to speak against these violations, and plea a change for what laws apply to Open AI, to defend and secure future author’s work. </p>
